# Why donate with crypto

**6 Reasons Why You Should Accept Crypto Donations**

Here below you can find a short list of benefits in accepting Bitcoin and other cryptos.

1. Target a new segment of possible donors, constituted by a growing amount of people that own Bitcoin.
2. Add a new method of payment and maximise the volume of donations.
3. Boost your brand and get a visibility return, as a forefront charity in innovative technologies.
4. Improve the knowledge of your employees, donors and stakeholders about this movement.
5. Provide a charitable solution to bitcoin holders that have to pay capital gains taxes (tax deduction is available in U.S. and other countries).
6. Be different: today only few charities accept Bitcoin and you could get the attention of crypto philanthropists.
