# Send

In the past, if you wanted to send crypto to another person, you needed their wallet address, which consists of a long string of letters and numbers. Today, all you need is an email address, phone number or ens, making it easier than ever to send cryptocurrencies using MixPay.

If you’re a MixPay customer, you can also send crypto to any email address in 20+ countries instantly and for free. Just open your [Mixin Messenger](https://mixin.one/messenger), select the crypto and an amount, enter the email address of recipient, and click send.

It's super easy to send cryptos via email address, phone number or ens. Even if the recipient is not in MixPay yet. The sender just writes an email address.

When he hits `Send`, his email app is opened with prefilled text for the recipient. The sender can edit it before sending. The recipient receives an email like this.

Recipient clicks the link and the money is added to his balance. If he doesn't have a wallet yet, he is prompted to install [Mixin Messenger](https://mixin.one/messenger) in order to receive the money. Simple as hell.

If the sender makes a mistake in the email address or chooses a wrong recipient, the money is not lost. The sender can claim the money back using the same way. It is saved in the wallet for such occasions, and a `Redeem` link is available on transaction details page.

This is like PayPal but with one important difference. The money is not kept in custody of PayPal or any other third party. The money is sent directly, from sender to recipient, peer-to-peer, in the spirit of crypto.
