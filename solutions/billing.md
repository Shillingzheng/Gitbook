Each month, [the utility company](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/utilities\_sector.asp) can send an eBill to a customer explaining the month’s charges and offering the ability to pay online. eBills offer a win-win for customers and businesses. Because they are faster, convenient, less expensive, and more secure, everyone involved benefits from [electronic billing](https://www.avidxchange.com/blog/what-is-electronic-billing/).
