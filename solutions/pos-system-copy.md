# POS System

What is Point-of-Sale (POS)?

A crypto [Point-of-Sale](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/point-of-sale.asp) (POS) is a solution for deploying a cryptocurrency payment gateway. The POS system enables your clients to pay for goods and services with Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies using their smartphone and crypto wallet. The main advantage of the POS method is the convenience since it takes mere seconds to create a link/QR that the customer can utilize to pay. The POS gateway is also simple to use and does not involve building complex infrastructure.

POS is generally a safe way of accepting cryptocurrencies for both the merchant and the client. It also lets the merchant fully customize their invoices and issue new ones for each client. That is why POS is an excellent option for small brick-and-mortar stores that do not need to process hundreds of payments per second.

In short, it is the point when the customer makes the payment in a physical store. A POS terminal processes and records transactions.

With the MixPay crypto Point-of-Sale system, your customers will be able to pay with cryptocurrency when buying from your offline store.

The Point-of-Sale gateway requires only two steps. The first one is entering the sum that your client needs to pay in the fiat currency of your choice. The second step is the auto-generation of the QR code.

Your client can scan the QR code using their phone and pay the sum which you specified earlier with the help of their mobile or desktop crypto wallet.**Regardless of what crypto your clients pay with, you can receive the fiat currency that you have chosen - MixPay converts them automatically.**

Point-of-sale systems offer a lot of benefits, such as quick payments, simple invoicing and the ability to manage your transactions. [Learn more about](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/point-of-sale.asp) POS.
