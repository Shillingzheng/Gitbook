# DAO

Soooooon!

Can you imagine a way of organizing with other people around the world, without knowing each other and establishing your own rules, and making your own decisions autonomously all encoded on a Blockchain? Well, DAOs are making this real.

Wikipedia defines DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) as an organization represented by rules encoded as a transparent computer program, controlled by the organization members, and not influenced by a central government. As the rules are embedded into the code, no managers are needed, thus removing any bureaucracy or hierarchy hurdles.

The most important aspect of a DAO organization is managing funds, and MixPay provides multi-signature capabilities that allow DAO organizations to easily and securely accept and spend funds. A DAO's multi-signature wallet consists of members of the DAO, each member has the same role in the multi-signature wallet, and each person can initiate a transfer, and as long as the amount of person signed meets the multi-signature threshold, the transfer can be successfully completed.
