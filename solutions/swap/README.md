description: A better on-chain swap experience than Changelly.

# Swap

If you're an experienced crypto user, you've probably heard of or used [Changelly](https://changelly.com/), which is a product that has been around since 2015. What does this product do? Simply put, it is an on-chain token exchange platform. For example, if you have BTC and want to convert it to ETH, it is difficult to do so without going through a centralized exchange. But you can do it with Changelly. The process works like this, you initiate a transaction at Changelly, enter the amount of BTC, then enter the address to receive ETH, then transfer a specific amount of BTC to the Changelly receiving address, so that after Changelly receives the BTC, after a long block confirmation and Changelly exchange transaction process, you will eventually receive ETH at your address.

What Changelly does in this process is actually transferring Bitcoin network assets to the Ethernet network, which is called cross-chain. The problem with Changelly is that the on-chain fees and the Changelly platform service fees are very high and not at all suitable for small amounts of money.

With the API provided by MixPay, you can develop a platform like Changelly and have a better experience, because MixPay's underlying technology, Mixin Network, is a very good cross-chain platform.

Mixin Network supports 41 major blockchains, covering more than 10,000 coins, and it supports second-level blocks confirmation, no gas fees, and completely anonymous transaction hash.

Swap-related APIs are not yet available, so stay tuned to MixPay.
