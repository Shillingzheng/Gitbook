# Offline payment

Purchases for cryptocurrency these days are no longer something amazing. In fact, accepting cryptos in a physical store does have significant benefits for merchants, as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are a [faster and cheaper](benefits.md) monetary exchange for merchants providing any services or goods.

[Brick-and-mortar](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brickandmortar.asp#toc-what-is-brick-and-mortar) retailers can accept cryptos from your customers in a very easy way. Cryptocurrency, despite its young age, has become the same payment instrument as fiat money. And if ten years ago you could only buy pizza and a glass of Coca-Cola for Bitcoin, now you can easily pay with cryptocurrencies for the purchase of a luxury car or a villa on the seashore.
