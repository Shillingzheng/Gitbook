# Swap

Cryptocurrency exchanges are platforms that facilitate the trading of cryptocurrencies for other assets, including digital and fiat currencies. In effect, cryptocurrency exchanges act as an intermediary between a buyer and a seller and make money through commissions and transaction fees.

On common cryptocurrency exchanges, $100 can be exchanged for bitcoin of equivalent value, and vice-versa. Similarly, bitcoin worth $100 can be exchanged for Ethereum of equivalent value. The same concept can be applied to different assets based on what is offered by the exchange.
