# why  to swap

In cryptocurrency, swapping refers to exchanging one coin or token for another. Sounds simple, but when you have over 1,500 different types of cryptos, things can get a little clunky.

The market is constantly expanding and every time a company feels ambitious, a new token is added to the mix. Each of these tokens represents not only new value but a potential investment venture. To some investors, that could shape their financial paths, so knowing how to swap effectively makes a big difference.

When faced with an overwhelming collection of coins, new traders often donâ€™t know how to proceed. They might have picked up a few tokens from one chain but see an opportunity to profit from another. This is where a lot of people follow the traditional method of conversion. They would convert the crypto to fiat currency and then use that to buy the coin they want. While this still works, it takes an extra step and you may have to pay transaction fees more than once.

Crypto swapping is a more seamless process that allows you to acquire the coin you want instantly. MixPay is a major exchange platform that will have this option available to its users to make trading as convenient as possible.&#x20;
