**Education Fees**

With a wide range of benefits offered in each educational course, the fees of institutions and universities are sky-high every year. It often becomes challenging to make big payments with cash. Hence, digital payments were introduced to make payments more manageable.

Bitcoin was added as part of digital payment for education. It was the University of Nicosia that first accepted Bitcoin as payment（**website link**） for its Digital Currency course.

It can be summed up that all the businesses that were accepting digital money are gradually moving towards cryptocurrency. Many online retailers have already started using BTC payments for their goods and services. ECommerce stores like Amazon and tech giants like Microsoft have already contributed to the popularity of BTC payments.

Egifters like Gyft remain a competition of Amazon when it comes to selling gift cards with Bitcoin as the payment method.

In Japan alone, there are approximately 260,000 commercial facilities using BTC payments in exchange for their products and services. Just like Japan, many other countries across the globe have been accepting Bitcoin payments.

Generally, a QR code is used to make Bitcoin payments when buying in retail stores. It has brought a wave of technological evolution in digital transactions by eliminating the chances of fraud and increasing the ease of payments. Those who have stacked some Bitcoin can now use it in local stores. It will not take long for offline retail stores to start accepting cryptocurrencies for their products and services.

**Automobile Industries**

When you are looking to buy a new automobile, your first instinct would be to think about arranging the finances. Today, automobile brands offer a wide range of payment methods for their customers that have eased their hassles. From cash to digital payments, there are plenty of payment modes.

Cryptocurrencies have become the newest option when it comes to digital payment modes. Many popular automobile brands trust cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as a medium of exchange. Tesla is a leading luxury car brand that was first to accept Bitcoin as the safest mode of the transaction as it does not have a dealership and facilitates the direct company-to-customer sale.

Another automobile brand that is popular for the use of Bitcoin is BMW, which offers its customers the choice of BTC payments.

There are many Bitcoin ATMs as well where you can get the Bitcoin for further payments. Currently, only BMW in the United States uses Bitcoin as the medium of exchange. BMW dealerships in other countries are also thinking of bringing in Bitcoin in their dealings.
