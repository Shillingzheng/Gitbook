# Guaranteed Transactions

Soooooon.

Imagine this scenario, Alice has goods, Bob has Crypto, Alice wants to sell the goods for Crypto, Bob wants to buy the goods with Crypto, but Alice doesn't trust Bob, Bob doesn't trust Alice, so what should we do? Alice and Bob only need to trust MixPay at the same time.

Of course, it's not exactly MixPay that you trust, but the technology behind MixPay, the multi-signature feature provided by Mixin Network.

MixPay provides a multi-signature API for easy access by developers and offers the function of guaranteed transactions.
